      <img src="./david-portrait.jpg" alt="David portrait" class="portrait px-border">
      <p class="text">I am an experienced developer transitioning from back-end database and development work to full stack web development.  I have worked for companies in the areas of finance, manufacturing, and retail.  I have been both a full-time employee and contractor to previous companies.</p>
      <p class="text">My last position was at DST Systems where my final title was a Database Consultant.  The primary goal of the position was to act as an advocate for the relational database, DB2.  On a daily basis, I would mentor developers in the best practices of DB2.  I also monitor the performance of the various client systems and develop recommendations to improve the program performance.  Tuning included SQL coding, COBOL coding, and how the languages worked together.  Other duties included administering a small test database used to test database features.  I handled all the design and coding of the database triggers.  I was also the sole developer on a VSAM transparency which allowed DST to move master data from VSAM files to DB2 tables.  On rare occasions, I was also tasked with writing complex programs.  Every year, I led the team to review and revise the database standards.  I taught database design concepts in corporate classes.  I wrote classes to explain features of the database like triggers & stored procedures, new version features, and SQL PL.  I tested and evaluated new features of DB2 with a team.</p>
      <p class="text">I wrote several REXX programs to make development easier.  The first would scan through hundreds of libraries to find where a program was located.  The second scanned through source programs to identify deprecated subroutine practices and non-standard code.  The second program was incorporated in the corporate software installation process.</p>
      <p class="text">Before becoming a Database Consultant, I was a senior developer working as part of the team to convert American Century onto the DST platform.  I led projects to enhance the DST system to include functions that the client had on their custom platform.  Projects included splitting purchases into multiple accounts, special handling for low balance accounts, and splitting output files so they could be sent to two different print vendors.</p>
